This is a simple note-taking extension for Chrome. Notes can be saved and loaded.
There is also an autosave feature so that you can close the notepad and re-open it
right where you left off. I wrote it because I often want to jot down notes while I'm
browsing, but don't want to open a separate application. As a result I would use 
old fashioned paper and then promptly lose the notes. This should sovle that.

Also used as an excercise in better jQuery and javascript organization using the module pattern, custom events, and templating.
